A Ruby implemenation of the Mongo interface.

embedded-mongo's goal is to provide the same interface as mongodb but
be embedded inside the calling process.  This allows unit tests to be
run without the overhead of database roundtrips or the creation of
ad-hoc mock layers.  It also allows one to start using the mongodb
interface for new projects without having to set up a real database.
